A system is said to be concurrent if it can support two or more actions "in progress" at the same time.

A system is said to be parallel if it can support two or more actions "executing" simultaneously.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This definition says that, in concurrent systems

Multiple actions can be in progress (may not be executed) at the same time. 

Meanwhile, multiple actions are simultaneously executed in parallel systems. 

In fact, concurrency and parallelism are conceptually overlapped to some degree.

but “in progress” clearly makes them different.

Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once.
